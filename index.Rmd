A collection of good journal articles related to methods used to study the microbiome. Contributions, in the form of pull requests on the github page are welcome.  Please include a description of the paper indicating its importance to the field.

## Good blog posts 

*Note that this is not a list of good blog sites - just single blog posts that are informative and useful*

Why do I have such a large distance matrix? - The mothur blog by Pat Schloss [link](http://blog.mothur.org/2014/09/11/Why-such-a-large-distance-matrix/)
 
 *A rather humorous blog post by Pat Scloss on why you should sequence way more than you think you need, and throw out anything without good quality and overlapping pairs*


## Other Collections 

All of [Microbiome Digest](https://microbiomedigest.com/) is particularly good but here are a couple of useful collections from that website.
