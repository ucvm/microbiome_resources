# Microbiome Resources

A collection of good journal articles related to methods used to study the microbiome.  Unlike the popular [Microbiome Digest](https://microbiomedigest.com/) the purpose of this page is to provide a list of curated foundational papers that, for the most part, will remain static.  Contributions, in the form of pull requests on the github page are welcome.  Please include a description of the paper indicating its importance to the field.
